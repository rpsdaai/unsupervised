# unsupervised
Using unsupervised learning, particularly clustering techniques like K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering, the objective is to identify the most vulnerable countries for strategic aid distribution.

Using unsupervised learning, particularly clustering techniques like K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering, the problem can be summarized as follows:

Objective:
HELP International has $10 million in funding and needs to identify the most vulnerable countries for strategic aid distribution.

Approach Using Unsupervised Learning:
- Data Collection & Preprocessing – Use socio-economic and health indicators (e.g., GDP per capita, child mortality rate, life expectancy).
- Feature Scaling – Normalize data to ensure consistent cluster formation.
- Clustering Analysis – Apply K-Means, DBSCAN, or Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to categorize countries into groups based on their development status.
- Cluster Evaluation – Identify the cluster with lowest economic and health indices.
- Recommendation – Suggest the most vulnerable countries that require immediate aid.

Outcome:
The clustering results will help the CEO prioritize countries, ensuring that funds are allocated to the nations most in need.
